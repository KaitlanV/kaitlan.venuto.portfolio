The contents of this portfolio are an archive of past and current artwork that I have made. My work is very multidisciplinary in reference to medium, because I like to explore different ways to portray the themes I am interested in. Oftentimes, my artwork revolves around themes of queerness, the expression of femininity, and sesnsory experience.
